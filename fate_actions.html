            <h2>The Engine of Interactive Storytelling</h2>
            <p>Fate's action resolution system is like the grammar of dramatic storytelling—it provides the structure that lets you communicate complex ideas simply and clearly. Unlike systems that focus on simulation or tactical complexity, Fate's mechanics are designed to maintain narrative momentum while creating meaningful choices and dramatic tension. Every roll should either advance the story or complicate it in interesting ways.</p>
            
            <div class="analogy-box">
                <h3>The Improvisation Framework Analogy</h3>
                <p>Think of Fate's action system like the "Yes, and..." principle of improvisational theater. The dice don't just tell you whether you succeed or fail—they tell you how the story continues. A failed roll doesn't stop the narrative; it redirects it in a more complicated direction. Success doesn't end the scene; it empowers the character to push the story forward. The mechanics exist to create dramatic moments, not to simulate reality in detail.</p>

            <h2>The Four Outcomes: Beyond Success and Failure</h2>
            
            <p>Fate uses four possible outcomes that create rich, nuanced results instead of simple binary success/failure. This system ensures that every roll contributes to the story in meaningful ways.</p>

            <h3>Failure: Complications, Not Dead Ends</h3>
            <p>Failure in Fate means the story becomes more complicated, not that it stops. The GM has several tools to make failure interesting:</p>

            <div class="failure-options">
                <div class="failure-type">
                    <h4>Simple Failure</h4>
                    <p>You don't accomplish what you set out to do, and the situation remains unchanged or gets worse</p>
                    <p><strong>Example:</strong> You fail to pick the lock, and now you hear footsteps approaching</p>
                </div>

                <div class="failure-type">
                    <h4>Success at a Serious Cost</h4>
                    <p>You achieve your goal, but something significant goes wrong</p>
                    <p><strong>Example:</strong> You pick the lock, but you break your tools and set off a silent alarm</p>
                </div>

                <div class="failure-type">
                    <h4>Aspect Creation</h4>
                    <p>The GM creates a new situational aspect that complicates the scene</p>
                    <p><strong>Example:</strong> You fail to stay hidden, creating the aspect "Guards on High Alert"</p>
                </div>
            </div>

            <h3>Success: Achievement with Momentum</h3>
            <p>Success means you accomplish what you set out to do and the story moves forward in your favor.</p>

            <div class="success-examples">
                <h4>Success Examples by Action Type</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Overcome:</strong> You bypass the obstacle and continue with your plan</li>
                    <li><strong>Create Advantage:</strong> You establish a beneficial aspect with one free invoke</li>
                    <li><strong>Attack:</strong> You deal stress to your target</li>
                    <li><strong>Defend:</strong> You avoid the incoming attack or effect</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h3>Success with Style: Excellence Rewarded</h3>
            <p>When you succeed by 3 or more shifts, you don't just accomplish your goal—you do it so well that you gain an additional benefit.</p>

            <div class="style-benefits">
                <h4>Success with Style Benefits</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Overcome:</strong> You get a boost aspect in addition to overcoming the obstacle</li>
                    <li><strong>Create Advantage:</strong> You get an extra free invoke on the aspect you created</li>
                    <li><strong>Attack:</strong> You deal normal stress and get a boost</li>
                    <li><strong>Defend:</strong> You defend successfully and get a boost</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h3>Success at a Cost: Drama from Difficult Choices</h3>
            <p>This outcome creates some of Fate's most dramatic moments—you get what you want, but there's a price to pay.</p>

            <div class="cost-examples">
                <h4>Types of Costs</h4>
                <div class="cost-type">
                    <h5>Resource Cost</h5>
                    <p>Spend something valuable to succeed</p>
                    <p><strong>Example:</strong> You convince the guard to let you pass, but you have to give him your last bribe money</p>
                </div>

                <div class="cost-type">
                    <h5>Complication</h5>
                    <p>Create a new problem or aspect</p>
                    <p><strong>Example:</strong> You hack the computer, but you're now "Traced by Corporate Security"</p>
                </div>

                <div class="cost-type">
                    <h5>Escalation</h5>
                    <p>The situation becomes more intense or dangerous</p>
                    <p><strong>Example:</strong> You disarm the bomb, but the timer speeds up on the other bombs</p>
                </div>

                <div class="cost-type">
                    <h5>Delay</h5>
                    <p>Success takes longer than expected</p>
                    <p><strong>Example:</strong> You pick the lock, but it takes so long that you miss your rendezvous</p>

            <h3>Challenges: Complex Tasks Requiring Multiple Skills</h3>
            <p>Challenges represent complex situations that require multiple different approaches or skills to resolve completely.</p>

                    <li><strong>Multiple Skills Required:</strong> Different aspects of the problem need different approaches</li>
                    <li><strong>Escalating Consequences:</strong> Failures make subsequent attempts harder</li>
                    <li><strong>Time Pressure:</strong> Limited number of attempts before consequences</li>
                    <li><strong>Collaborative Solutions:</strong> Different characters can contribute different skills</li>

                        <li><strong>Physical Infiltration:</strong> Burglary or Athletics vs. Fair (+2) - bypass physical security</li>
                        <li><strong>Social Camouflage:</strong> Rapport or Deceive vs. Fair (+2) - blend in with the elite</li>
                        <li><strong>Technical Access:</strong> Computers vs. Great (+4) - hack the CEO's computer</li>

                    <p><strong>Round 2:</strong> Sarah uses Burglary to disable the office alarms (Failure) - Security systems are more advanced than expected, creating "Enhanced Security Protocols"</p>
                    <p><strong>Round 3:</strong> Elena uses Rapport at the party (Success at a Cost) - She charms the CEO but he becomes romantically interested, complicating the mission</p>
                    <p><strong>Round 4:</strong> Maya uses Computers to hack the system (Success with Style) - Not only gets the data but plants false evidence</p>
                    <p><strong>Result:</strong> Mission succeeds, but Elena now has an unwanted admirer, and enhanced security will make future infiltrations harder</p>

            <h3>Contests: Head-to-Head Competition</h3>

            <h2>Conflicts: When Violence and Drama Collide</h2>
            
            <p>Conflicts are Fate's most structured scenes, used when characters are trying to harm each other or when the situation is dangerous enough that failure could result in being taken out of the scene.</p>

            <h3>Defining Zones</h3>

                <div class="teamwork-type">
                    <h4>Advantages for Allies</h4>
                    <p>Create situational aspects that teammates can invoke</p>
                    <p><strong>Example:</strong> Sarah creates "Suppressing Fire" that Marcus can invoke for his infiltration attempt</p>
                </div>

                <div class="teamwork-type">
                    <h4>Passing Boosts</h4>
                    <p>Give your success with style boost to an ally</p>
                    <p><strong>Example:</strong> Elena's research creates a boost that she gives to Maya for her hacking attempt</p>

                <div class="teamwork-type">
                    <h4>Combined Actions</h4>
                    <p>Multiple characters contribute to the same task</p>
                    <p><strong>Example:</strong> Marcus provides muscle while Sarah provides technical expertise to break into a safe</p>
                </div>

                <div class="teamwork-type">
                    <h4>Splitting Shifts</h4>
                    <p>Distribute the results of a successful attack among multiple targets</p>

                    <p><strong>Marcus (Defend with Fight):</strong> Delays the guards in hand-to-hand combat</p>

            <h2>Conclusion: The Flow of Dramatic Action</h2>
            
            <p>Fate's action resolution system is designed to keep stories moving forward while creating meaningful dramatic moments. Every roll should either advance the plot or complicate it in interesting ways—never simply stop the story dead. The four outcomes ensure that dice results contribute to narrative momentum rather than fighting against it.</p>

            <p>The key insight is that Fate mechanics serve the story, not the other way around. Difficulties should reflect dramatic importance, not just task complexity. Conflicts should create character moments, not just tactical puzzles. Teamwork should feel natural and rewarding because the characters' success depends on their relationships and cooperation.</p>

            <div class="action-principles">
                <h3>Core Action Resolution Principles</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Fiction first:</strong> What you can attempt depends on what makes narrative sense</li>
                    <li><strong>Failure advances:</strong> Failed rolls complicate the story, they don't stop it</li>
                    <li><strong>Success has style:</strong> Exceptional rolls provide extra benefits</li>
                    <li><strong>Costs create drama:</strong> Success at a cost generates difficult decisions</li>
                    <li><strong>Teamwork matters:</strong> Characters are stronger when they work together</li>
                    <li><strong>Aspects drive outcomes:</strong> Character traits should influence every important roll</li>
                </ul>
